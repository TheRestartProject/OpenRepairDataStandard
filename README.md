# Open Repair Data Standard

We are building a standard for the collection and sharing of open data on
electronics repair.

The goal of this standard is to build a data repository on recurrent faults and
other barriers to repair, to provide strong quantitative analysis on the
positive benefits that can be brought about by repair and reuse.  
We are building the standard such that data collection on repair is open and
interoperable, and can be used for impactful statistical analysis and
visualisation.

See the 
[the goals page](https://github.com/TheRestartProject/OpenRepairDataStandard/blob/master/Goals.md) 
for more information on what we intend to achieve.


## Background

At The Restart Project we have been organising community repair events around the UK and supporting their replication internationally over the past four years.  From these events we have been building a repository of data on fixes and repairability, and on the positive social and environmental impacts of repairing devices. See https://therestartproject.org/fixometer/ for more information on our work on this so far.

For our community repair events we have been using a purpose-built web application to collect our data. The source code for this application is available at: https://github.com/TheRestartProject/Fixometer 

## Current Status

The Fixometer has been in use for the last 2 years by over 15 Restart repair groups. We've built up a helpful repository of data on fixes and repairability, and on the positive social and environmental impacts of our work.  We are currently scaling up the collection of data and exploring various partnerships - with other community repair networks, and with trade associations of independent commercial repairers. From these partnerships we envisage a rapid growth in the data collected, and we wish to ensure this data is open and interoperable.

Presently we log the fixes we attempt — successful or not — at our community’s repair events around the world. We log data points such as the model and brand of the device, what the problem was, whether we could fix it, and whether spare parts were required. We then combine this data with our research data of product lifecycle assessments for a wide variety of small electrical and electronics products. From these two datasets (downloadable [here](https://therestartproject.org/download-dataset/) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MMkPsyrI6ulWkyz6tJbXONUXiOqKWj2v-2cSPJEzuEo/edit#gid=0)) we produce detailed analysis on the positive environmental and social impacts of our work.

Read about the current values we are recording [here](https://github.com/TheRestartProject/OpenRepairDataStandard/blob/master/Current%20Structure.md).  This is the starting point for expansion into the open standard.
