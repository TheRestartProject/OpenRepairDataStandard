# Open Repair Data Standard

We are building a standard for the collection and sharing of open data on electronics repair.  

The goal of this standard is to build a data repository on recurrent faults and other barriers to repair, to provide strong quantitative analysis on the positive benefits that can be brought about by repair and reuse.   

We are building the standard such that data collection on repair is open and interoperable, and can be used for impactful statistical analysis and visualisation.

## Background

At The Restart Project we have been organising community repair events around the UK and supporting their replication internationally over the past four years.  From these events we have been building a repository of data on fixes and repairability, and on the positive social and environmental impacts of repairing devices. See https://therestartproject.org/faq/ and https://therestartproject.org/impact/ for more information on our work on this so far.

For our community repair events we have been using a purpose-built web application to collect our data. The source code for this application is available at: https://github.com/TheRestartProject/Fixometer 

## Current Status

We are currently scaling up the collection of data and exploring various partnerships - with other community repair networks, and with trade associations of independent commercial repairers. From these partnerships we envisage a rapid growth in the data collected.
