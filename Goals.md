# Goals

The open repair data standard builds on the data collected from
the Restart Project's Fixometer application.  Through the standard
we aim to scale up data collection, and with strategic analysis of this
data provide many benefits for the repair economy.

We aim to:

* Create an open data standard for post-warranty repairs together with other
community repair networks, repair SMEs and other organisations with access to repair data.

* Aggregate data on what is breaking and barriers to repair, to influence and support the work of decision-makers and regulators.

* Support waste prevention and resource efficiency through the rebirth of a 
vibrant commercial repair sector. 

* Inform manufacturers and retailers of consumers' frustration with the status quo.

## Benefits and services

### For community repair and citizens

* Allow community repair organisers to log all performed repairs, capturing the 
environmental and social impact of their work: the weight of waste prevented, the 
CO2 prevented by displacing unnecessary purchases and the hours volunteered

* Capture information about the types of faults and the most recurrent 
ones

* Capture information about the success rate of repairs performed per each
product category, the requirement for spare parts, and most importantly
information on specific brands and models

* Generate a publicly accessible repository on the post-warranty repair economy

* Provide unique insights and trends on recurrent faults, missed opportunities
for the repair sector, barriers to repair and data about the reliability of
specific brands and models

* Produce data linking faults and repairability rates with specific brands and
  products


### For repair SMEs

* Repair SMEs will seamlessly log data about their activities, receiving in
exchange an environmental report of the impact of their work.

* We will work with commercial repairers open about the standards of their work and committed to documenting the challenges they face.

* Through their involvement they will become more visible to the public and
might access additional opportunities.

### For manufacturers

* Manufacturers will be able to access data about their products normally not
  available to them.

* While most in-warranty repairs are performed by a manufacturer's authorised
repair network or directly in-house, post-warranty repairs are often not, and data
about them is much harder to gather.

* The type of information we collect can be instrumental for prioritising
changes in the design of future products or services.

* Access to most frustrating recurrent faults that consumers are willing to
repair could provide them with insights into what might lead a consumer to switch
brand or confirm loyalty.


### For regulators and policy-makers

* Provide a unique barometer of citizen frustration and demand for action:
improvements on design, spare part provision, repair services and prolonged
support.

* Access to a new source of information on product failure, to give policy-makers independent data to back their efforts during
investigations, research and negotiations.

* Examples could include support to revisions of ecodesign criteria or research on early obsolescence linked to availability of spare parts or lack of software support.

## For other organisations

Other sources and potential beneficiaries of open repair data could be insurance companies;
consumers' associations; retailers; academic institutions.
