# Goals

The open repair data standard builds on the data collected from
the Restart Project's Fixometer application.  Through the standard
we aim to scale up data collection, and with strategic analysis of this
data provide many benefits for the repair economy.

We aim to:

* Create an open data standard for post-warranty repairs together with other
community repair networks and repair SMEs, aggregating data on what is breaking
and barriers to repair, and influence decision-makers and regulators in
Brussels.

* Scale up waste prevention and resource efficiency through the rebirth of a 
vibrant commercial repair sector. 

* Inform manufacturers and retailers of consumers' frustration with the status quo.

* Produce much more data and evidence to help regulators take the right decisions.

## Benefits and services

### For community repair and citizens

* Allow repair organisers to log all performed repairs, capturing the 
environmental and social impact of their work: the weight of waste prevented, the 
CO2 prevented by displacing unnecessary purchases and the hours volunteered

* Capture information about the types of faults and the most recurrent 
ones

* Capture information about the success rate of repairs performed per each
product category, the requirement for spare parts, and most importantly
information on specific brands and models

* Generate a publicly accessible repository on the post-warranty repair economy

* Provide unique insights and trends on recurrent faults, missed opportunities
for the repair sector, barriers to repair and data about the reliability of
specific brands and models

* Produce data linking faults and repairability rates with specific brands and
  products


### For repair SMEs

* Repair SMEs will seamlessly log data about their activities, receiving in
exchange an environmental report of the impact of their work.

* Restart will work with commercial repairers providing information on the
standards of their work, such as: provision of warranty and provenance of parts.

* Through their involvement they will become more visible to the public and
might access additional opportunities via manufacturers, spare parts providers
and others.

### For manufacturers

* Manufacturers will be able to access data about their products normally not
  available to them.

* While most in-warranty repairs are performed by a manufacturer's authorised
repair network or directly in-house, post-warranty repairs are not, and data
about them is much harder to gather.

* Consumers often rely on third-party repairers or give up on brands entirely,
  at times ignoring their consumer rights.

* The type of information we collect can be instrumental for prioritising
changes in manufacturers' future products or services.

* Access to most frustrating recurrent faults that consumers are willing to
repair will provide them with insights into what might lead a consumer to switch
brand or confirm loyalty.


### For regulators and policy-makers

* Provide a unique barometer of citizen frustration and demand for action:
improvements on design, spare part provision, repair services and prolonged
support.

* Allow for the comparison of actual failure rates of specific products and
brands, to give policy-makers independent data to back their efforts during
investigations, research and negotiations.

* Examples could include the need to review regulations on availability of
quality or genuine spare parts; new approaches to authorising distribution of
products in the EU based on repairability, faults, service provision.

## For other organisations

Other potential beneficiaries of open repair data could be insurance companies;
consumers' associations; retailers; academic institutions.
